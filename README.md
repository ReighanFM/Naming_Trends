# Naming Trends:
>A quick timeseries analysis using the SSA baby names dataset

Every year the U.S. Social Security Administration releases a dataset of births and registered names. This dataset being open source is commonly used for training purposes within data science and statistics (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kaggle/us-baby-names). It has also brought to light several trends over the years due to the size and trainability of the data. 

While working with this dataset for course work, I came across another trend.

In this short data analysis I will show a decrease in common Latin American first names in the US starting from the year 2000 and continuing today
